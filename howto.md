Prompt: So I like the minimal mistakes template for GitHub pages. How can I manage both to deploy the page in github pages, as well as deploy locally in my laptop so that I can see how it renders? I seem to be able to do one or the other, but not both. What would be the proper steps to have both things working?

To manage both local deployment and GitHub Pages deployment using the Minimal Mistakes theme, you can follow these steps. This approach will allow you to work on your site locally while also ensuring it can be deployed to GitHub Pages:

Step 1: Setup Your Project
Fork or Clone the Minimal Mistakes Theme:
If starting fresh, fork the Minimal Mistakes repo from GitHub. Alternatively, use the Minimal Mistakes Starter for GitHub Pages for a more straightforward setup. Rename the repository to <username>.github.io for a user site or use any name for project sites.
Edit Gemfile:
For local development and GitHub Pages compatibility, keep your Gemfile like this:
ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "jekyll-include-cache", group: :jekyll_plugins
The github-pages gem mimics the GitHub Pages environment, allowing local builds to closely match what GitHub Pages will produce.
Configure _config.yml:
Add or ensure you have this line for GitHub Pages:
yaml
remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"
If you're customizing locally, you might want a separate _config_local.yml for local settings:
yaml
# _config_local.yml
theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll

Step 2: Local Development
Install Bundler and Gems:
From your project directory, run:
bundle install
Run Jekyll Serve Locally:
To see how your site renders locally, use:
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_local.yml
This command uses both your main config and any local overrides. If you don't have a _config_local.yml, just use _config.yml.

Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Ensure GitHub Pages Settings:
Push your changes to GitHub. In your repository's settings under "Pages", make sure the source is set to "GitHub Actions" or "Deploy from branch" for a more manual approach.
GitHub Actions for Automatic Builds (Recommended):
Create a .github/workflows/pages.yml file in your repo for automatic deployment:
yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or master if that's your main branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: vendor/bundle
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile.lock') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-gems-
    - uses: helaili/jekyll-action@v2
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
This setup uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy your site when you push to the main branch.

Step 4: Switching Between Local and GitHub Pages
For Local: Use bundle exec jekyll serve with your local config if you have one. 
For GitHub: Ensure your _config.yml has remote_theme set, and push changes to GitHub.

Notes:
Local Testing vs. GitHub Pages: There might be slight differences due to plugins or versions. Use the github-pages gem locally to minimize these discrepancies.
Customizations: If you've made significant changes or added custom plugins, you might need to manually deploy if GitHub Pages doesn't support them or use a CI service for more flexibility.

By following these steps, you can maintain both a local development environment where you can see changes in real-time and have GitHub Pages automatically deploy your site when you're ready to go live.
