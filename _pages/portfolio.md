Hi! I’m Benji, a Product Manager.
My portfolio shows how I’ve delivered results with strategy and collaboration.
Most things here belong to collective efforts.
Here are some of my works, in the spirit of [OnePage/OneHour](https://www.onepageonehour.com/about).
I share results, my thinking process and projects.
